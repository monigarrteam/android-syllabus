## HOMEWORK/PROJECTS

All assignments are listed in the following [Course Outline](#course-outline).

### WORKFLOW

Overall steps with GitHub Desktop:

1. [GitHub Instructions](https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/contributing/) 
1. Request Access to a specific Project's repository from monigarr@yahoo.com 
1. Fork Repository for the exercise/project (found under [github.com/monigarrteam](https://github.com/monigarrteam/projectname)).
1. Clone Repository to your computer.  $git clone http://www.urltoyourownrepository.com
1. Create New Android Project in your local computer repository.
1. Work on your Android Project in Android Studio and save your work in your local computer's repository. 
1. Commit All Your Code. $git add -A   $git commit -m "description of your work"
1. Push Your Code to your GitHub forked repository.   $git push origin master
1. [Create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) on the original repository before Friday midnight. 

When your pull request is created, you should see a message saying "the Travis CI build is in progress" – that means your solution is being automagically checked for syntax errors.  If your "build" ends up failing (which will show a red "X"), click through the "details" link and scroll to the bottom to see what your errors are.  Per [requirements](#requirements), Please fix your issues and push up the changes.

Feedback is only provided in your pull request, so please respond with your thoughts and questions!  You can open the pull request as the work is still in-progress if you are stuck and want to ask a question – just mention `@monigarr` with the question to make sure the instructor will know to look at it sooner.

Your solution will be live at `http://YOURUSERNAME.github.io/YOURPROJECTNAME`.  For exercises with multiple levels/versions, leave a new comment in the pull request saying "Level X finished!" before pushing commits for the next level. "BONUS" levels are for extra credit.

### REQUIREMENTS

* [Travis CI](https://docs.travis-ci.com/) build must pass.
* Must practice "good programming style"
    * Functions should be "short" (see [Sandi Metz's rules for developers](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/sandi-metz-rules-for-developers)).
    * Optimize for Readability.
        * ["Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute." -Harold Abelson](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/9168-programs-must-be-written-for-people-to-read-and-only)
    * Avoid using anonymous callbacks within other functions, especially if the callback is more than one or two lines.
    * For projects, use Object-Oriented Programming.
* Any borrowed code must be properly [annotated](http://documentup.com/advanced-js/syllabus#statements-on-plagiarism/instructor).
* Bonus Points for:
    * [Unit Testing with 50% or more code coverage]
    * [Optimization Techniques]
    * [Creativity] as long as requirements are fulfilled

## STATEMENTS ON PLAGIARISM

Plagiarism is a form of fraud.  The definition of plagiarism is as follows: "Plagiarism is presenting someone else's work as though it were one's own.  More specifically, plagiarism is to present as one's own words quoted without quotation marks from another writer; a paraphrased passage from another writer’s work; or facts or ideas gathered, organized, and reported by someone else, orally and/or in writing.  Since plagiarism is a matter of fact, not of the student's intention, it is crucial that acknowledgement of the sources be accurate and complete.  Even where there is not a conscious intention to deceive, the failure to make appropriate acknowledgement constitutes plagiarism.

### INSTRUCTOR

Reuse and building on other ideas and code are major parts of modern software development. Each new generation of software engineers do build on the shoulders of current and past giants. As a professional you rarely write anything from scratch.  This class is structured so that all solutions are public.  You are encouraged to learn from the work of your peers. People who copy-and-paste solutions without challenging themselves & understanding the content are wasting their own time and money.

Please respect the terms of use and/or license of any code you find. If you reimplement or duplicate an algorithm or code from elsewhere, credit the original source with an inline comment.
