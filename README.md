## HOMEWORK/PROJECTS

All your assignments are listed within the [Course Outline](#course-outline).

### WORKFLOW

If you're using GitHub Desktop, [these instructions](https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/contributing/) will help explain the Git/GitHub concepts. Here are the overall steps:

1. Fork the repository for the exercise/project (found under [github.com/monigarrteam](https://github.com/monigarrteam)).
1. Clone the repository to your computer.
1. Create a New Android Project or Open your Existing Android Project in the same directory that your repository is found on your own computer.
1. Work on your New or Existing Android Project in Android Studio and save your work in your local computer's repository. 
1. Commit all your code. 
1. Push/sync your code up to GitHub.
1. [Create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) on the original repository. 
1. All work is due by Thursday midnight the latest, unless otherwise specified.
1. You can continue to push fixes and improvements until the close date (listed in Classes) – just add a comment in the pull request to let the instructor know your work has been updated.

When the pull request is created, you should see a message saying that "the Travis CI build is in progress" – this means your solution is being automatically checked for syntax errors.  If this "build" ends up failing (which will show a red "X"), click through the "details" link and scroll to the bottom to see what the errors were.  Per the [requirements](#requirements) below, please fix your issues and push up the changes.

Feedback will be given in the pull request, so please respond with your thoughts and questions!  You are welcome to open the pull request as the work is still in-progress if you are stuck and want to ask a question – just mention `@monigarr` with the question to make sure the instructor will know to look at it sooner.

Your solution will also be live at `http://USERNAME.github.io/YOURPROJECTNAME`.  For exercises with multiple levels/versions, leave a new comment in the pull request saying "Level X finished!" before pushing commits for the next level. "BONUS" levels are for extra credit.

### REQUIREMENTS

These apply to real life, as well.

* [Travis CI](https://docs.travis-ci.com/) build should pass and includes:
    * All HTML files should pass [W3C Markup Validation](http://validator.w3.org).
    * All written JS should pass [JSHint](http://jshint.com).
* Must apply "good programming style" learned in class
    * Functions should be "short" (see [Sandi Metz's rules for developers](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/sandi-metz-rules-for-developers)).
    * Optimize for readability.
        * ["Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute." -Harold Abelson](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/9168-programs-must-be-written-for-people-to-read-and-only)
    * Avoid using anonymous callbacks within other functions, especially if the callback is more than one or two lines.
    * For projects, use Object-Oriented Programming.
* Any borrowed code must be properly [annotated](http://documentup.com/advanced-js/syllabus#statements-on-plagiarism/instructor).
* Bonus points for:
    * [Automated tests](#test-frameworks)
    * Creativity as long as requirements are fulfilled

## STATEMENTS ON PLAGIARISM

Plagiarism is a form of fraud.  The definition of plagiarism is as follows: "Plagiarism is presenting someone else's work as though it were one's own.  More specifically, plagiarism is to present as one's own words quoted without quotation marks from another writer; a paraphrased passage from another writer’s work; or facts or ideas gathered, organized, and reported by someone else, orally and/or in writing.  Since plagiarism is a matter of fact, not of the student's intention, it is crucial that acknowledgement of the sources be accurate and complete.  Even where there is not a conscious intention to deceive, the failure to make appropriate acknowledgement constitutes plagiarism.  Penalties for plagiarism range from failure for an assignment or course to dismissal from the course.

### INSTRUCTOR

Reuse and building on other ideas and code are major parts of modern software development. Each new generation of software engineers do build on the shoulders of current and past giants. As a professional you rarely write anything from scratch.  This class is structured so that all solutions are public.  You are encouraged to learn from the work of your peers. People who are copying-and-pasting solutions without challenging themselves & understanding the course materials are wasting their own time and money taking this course.

Please respect the terms of use and/or license of any code you find. If you reimplement or duplicate an algorithm or code from elsewhere, credit the original source with an inline comment.
